 *  File that holds the main page for the flex sensor portion of the RobotArm
 *  project.
 *  @mainpage
 *  @section intro Introduction
 *  The term project is to design a robot arm that can move at an elbow joing,
 *  wrist, and fingers. The arm will be operated by wearing a glove and moving
 *  it to desired positions.
 * 
 *  @section software Software Design
 *  Software is development in two parts one that interfaces with flex sensors
 *  and one that interfaces with an IMU. The code corresponding to the flex
 *  sensors control 5 finger servos. The code corresponding to the IMU control
 *  the wrist and arm motion, with a DC motor and linear actuator respectively.
